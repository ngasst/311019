-   In `App.js` create your routing logic and your navigation
-   One route will lead to a `FunctionalComponents` component
    -   That component will be implemented using a functional component
    -   It will have a short explanation _in your own words_ about what such a thing is
-   The other route will lead to a `ClassComponent` component
    -   It will be implemented as a class component
    -   It will also have a short explanation about what a class component is
-   Everything must be styled using `styled-components`
    -   The styling is left to your creative imagination
    -   Use the example in App.js (before you delete that code, it might be a good idea to either comment it, or duplicate it inside of another file) on how to use styled-components
-   I'm available to answer questions, of course, but think to check on the Internet and reach out _only_ if you are blocked and/or frustrated.
